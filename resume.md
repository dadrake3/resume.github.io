> ### <span>Akuna Capital<span style="float: right">Hybrid / Chicago, IL</span></span>
> #### <span>Quantitative Software Developer<span style="float: right">Aug 2019 - Jan 2023</span></span>

- Led a cross-functional team of 7+ indirect reports to develop a high throughput streaming system in Python, providing real-time analysis of trade execution and portfolio risk to 30+ trading desks.

- Designed, deployed, and managed scalable data ETL pipelines using Python, Scala, Apache Flink, and Apache Kafka on an AWS Elastic Kubernetes cluster, which handled tens of millions of trades per day with a p95 latency of less than 10 seconds.

- Orchestrated the lifecycle of our services using Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, and Jenkins, resulting in a seemless development and deployment process and 100% test coverage.

- Constructed comprehensive monitoring dashboards and alerts systems utilizing Loki, Grafana, and Prometheus to ensure 24/7 availability of our data and services.

- Built automated workflows in Databricks and Argo for backfills, daily report generation, and other data quality assuance checks to guarantee a 1 to 1 correspondance between our input and output databases.

- Collaborated closely with traders to conduct quantitative analysis of trading data using Apache Spark, PostgreSQL, and Pandas to uncover patterns and diagnose issues within our data infrastructure.

- Administered multiple Postgres Timescale databases and replicas, using pgBouncer, pgBadger, and pgBench, to optimize performance across 100s of connections while maintaining reliable and secure access to our database.

<!-- - Revamped extensive Python libraries utilized company-wide for efficient data storage and manipulation, and for seamless interfacing with our C++ math APIs. -->

<!-- - Transformed Jupyter notebooks into production-ready Python dashboards using Pandas and Matplotlib, enabling traders and researchers to interact visually with our risk models. -->

> ### <span>Jump ARCHES Virtual Reality Lab<span style="float: right">Urbana, IL</span></span>
> #### <span>Software Developer / Research Assistant<span style="float: right">September 2017 - March 2019</span></span>

- Produced a virtual reality teaching environment using the Unity game engine, Steam VR and C#, enabling medical students to interact with human anatomy outside of the laboratory.

- Developed an image processing pipeline using Python and PyTorch for end to end generation of 3D models from 2D MRI and CT scans.


> ### <span>Epic Systems<span style="float: right">Verona, WI</span></span>
> #### <span>Software Development Intern <span style="float: right">May 2018 - August 2018</span></span>
